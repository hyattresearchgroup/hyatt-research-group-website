## About Us

The **Hyatt Research Group** at Adelphi University specializes in developing creative breakthroughs in **hypervalent iodine chemistry**. We aim to maintain a highly fundable research program, assist our undergraduate members in attaining their career goals, and ultimately publishing our results. Past members have elevated to positions in industry, graduate programs, and medical school, to name a few.

Our hypervalent iodine research employs the fields of molecular orbital theory, physical organic chemistry, reaction mechanisms, drug design, and the development of new reactions. Members learn advanced skills and techniques while using multi-million dollar instrumentation, preparing them for any scientific career they choose to pursue. Some of our work implements techniques on air/moisture sensitive reactions, column chromatography, 1D, 2D, and heteronuclear NMR, and advanced concepts in organic chemistry. Perhaps most importantly, our members are pushed to solve problems and use critical thinking where solutions are not present. Students have presented research at regional and national American Chemical Society conventions, and the International Conference on Hypervalent Iodine Chemistry.

The Hyatt Research Group also has projects in dental science and materials science. Both of these projects began with student ingenuity, and have expanded from ideas into group-spanning projects, theses, and publications. We have ongoing medical research in applying silver oximate compoounds as a dental antibiotic, as well as the use of spirolactams in combating Trichomoniasis vaginalis, a common STI. In the summer of 2023, we began our first research project on high temperature superconductivity, establishing Adelphi University's first materials science laboratory and initiative. Read more about these projects below.
