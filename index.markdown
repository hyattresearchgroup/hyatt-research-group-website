# Welcome to the Hyatt Research Group
_A synthetic chemistry research lab_

## About Us

The **Hyatt Research Group** at Adelphi University specializes in developing creative breakthroughs in **hypervalent iodine chemistry**. We aim to maintain a highly fundable research program, assist our undergraduate members in attaining their career goals, and ultimately publishing our results. Past members have elevated to positions in industry, graduate programs, and medical school, to name a few.

Our hypervalent iodine research employs the fields of molecular orbital theory, physical organic chemistry, reaction mechanisms, drug design, and the development of new reactions. Members learn advanced skills and techniques while using multi-million dollar instrumentation, preparing them for any scientific career they choose to pursue. Some of our work implements techniques on air/moisture sensitive reactions, column chromatography, 1D, 2D, and heteronuclear NMR, and advanced concepts in organic chemistry. Perhaps most importantly, our members are pushed to solve problems and use critical thinking where solutions are not present. Students have presented research at regional and national American Chemical Society conventions, and the International Conference on Hypervalent Iodine Chemistry.

## Our Projects:

* **Hypervalent Iodine**
  * [Hypervalent Iodine-Guided Electrophilic Substitution](/higes/)
  * [Formation of Spirolactams for Trichomoniasis Vaginalis](/spirolactams-trichomoniasis/)
  * [Aggregation Induced Emission of Cycloheptatrienylidene Fluorophores](/cycloheptatrienylidene-fluorophores/)
* **High Temperature Superconductivity**
  * [Current work - Read More](/high-temperature-superconductivity/)

In the summer of 2023, we began our first research project on high temperature superconductivity, establishing Adelphi University's first materials science laboratory and initiative. Read more about that [here](/high-temperature-superconductivity/).
